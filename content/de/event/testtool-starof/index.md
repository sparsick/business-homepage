title: "Testing Tools in Java"
event: "Star of Java"
event_url: "https://java.starof.com/Testing-Tools-in-Java.html"
location: "Remote"
summary:
abstract: "
Tests are the main way developers communicate about the code. Tests are
used to communicate with the next developer even after they leave the
project. Tests are a living specification of the code they test. You
should keep them at least as clean as production code - if not cleaner.

But who hasn't heard the statement \"You can't test that\" or \"You can't
write the test more nicely\"? Often, these statements are based on the
fact that people are still unaware of most of the arsenal of testing
tools that are now available to us Java developers.

Besides JUnit 5, there are many other test tools that can simplify the
developer's everyday test writing. This talk will give an overview of
useful features of JUnit 5 and introduce not-so-familiar test tools that
make writing tests fun again"
