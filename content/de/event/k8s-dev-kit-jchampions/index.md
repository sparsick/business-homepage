# Abstract and optional shortened version.
abstract = "More and more developers are writing applications that will later run in a Kubernetes cluster. What can be so difficult about this? Starting with \"How do I structure my repositories?\", \"Where do I put my code for deployment (container files, helmet charts, config values)?\",\"What needs to be considered when developing the application?\", \"How do I get the code tested locally?\", \"How do I get to see what is happening in the test cluster?\"\n\nUsing a Java application as an example, this talk goes through the typical development steps from putting it in the VCS to deploying it on a cluster from a developer's perspective.
